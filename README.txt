# PiSpectrometer
Raspberry Pi Spectrometer project - python

This project is intended to hold the in-progress prototype of a spectrometer application.

Originally this was going to be built in .NET but microsoft does not support raspberry Pi hardware out of the box.  I am not going to write a windows driver for the Pi GPU or the NOIR camera, so this is where python comes in.  To avoid potential hiccups I have decided not to attempt to install the .NET runtime on raspbian.

All reference sources are currently compiled in my personal google drive.  I will list them here once I have a minimum viable product.

General idea here is to build an app I can run on a raspberry Pi that does some basic environment scanning via infared.
